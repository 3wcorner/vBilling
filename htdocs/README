                             What is vBilling
********************************************************************************

Team Digital Linx proudly presets, vBilling. An open source alternative billing
solution for FreeSWITCH. While utilizing the power of FreeSWITCH you can 
actually start your own VoIP business and even migrate an existing billing 
solution. You can create your own calling card services, SMS gateway, voice mail
and much more. You can also manage your VoIP wholesale business. And all of
this is done by a single web based interface. You would never have to leave the
beautifully designed web based GUI to do anything with FreeSWITCH.

Open Source software is mature and powerful. All components in this platform are 
fully open source. Which means you can download the software, configure and run
it. You can even change and re-distribute. Without any obligations! We developed 
vBilling using PHP and have used MySQL as the database layer.
